# Motivation

> Why use OneOps?


## Baremetal or Normal VM

- Sized for largest load
- Inefficient usage of resources
- Not dynamic enough

And hence not competitive!


## Cloud to the Rescue

What do you mean by _Cloud_ though?


## 5 Essential Cloud Characteristics

- On-demand self-service <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Broad network access <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Resource pooling <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Rapid elasticity <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Measured service <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## 3 Cloud Service Delivery Methods

- Software as a Service _SaaS_: <br> Consume cloud applications. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Platform as a Service _PaaS_: <br>Leverage the cloud for your own applications. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Infrastructure as a Service _IaaS_: <br> Be a cloud <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- SaaS is not enough, you dont control the application
- IaaS is to bare bones, but potentially necesary to run your own cloud
- PaasS .. great but you want to be your own PaaS to avoid dependence on PaaS provider


## Deployment Methods

- Public cloud: available to anyone <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Private cloud: only available to you <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Mixed <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- only mixed is truly competitive and possible on a global scale


## Cloud Provider

Either commercial company

- Amazon
- Microsoft
- Google
- Rackspace
- Others

Or your own provider using

- OpenStack
- Apache Cloudstack


## Which to Choose?

- Each cloud introduces lock-in with specific API and tools
- No cloud is available globally
- Different advantages over time and location
- Varying stability and up-time

Hence, choose none and use all of them.

Note:
- using multiple clouds is necessary but expensive
- use cloud agnostic tools to reduce cost


## OneOps

Abstracts your application from a specific cloud:

OneOps is the ultimate PaaS!

Design your application once and run and manage in any cloud.
