# Motivation

> Why use OneOps?


## Baremetal/VM

- Sized for largest load
- Not dynamic (enough) 

And hence not competitive in terms of price.

## Cloud to the Rescue

What do you mean by _Cloud_ though?


## 5 Essential Cloud Characteristics

- On-demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured service

from NIST http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf


## 3 Cloud Service Delivery Methods

- Software as a Service _SaaS_: Consume the cloud
- Platform as a Service _PaaS_: Leverage the cloud
- Infrastructure as a Service _IaaS_: Be a cloud


## Deployment Methods

- Private cloud
- Public cloud
- Mixed


## Which Cloud? 

- Each cloud platform introduces lock in
- No cloud is available globally


## OneOps

Abstracts your application from a specific cloud:

Its the ulitmate PaaS!
