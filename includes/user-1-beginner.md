# Motivation

> Why use OneOps?


## Baremetal or Normal VM

- Sized for largest load
- Inefficient usage of resources
- Not dynamic enough

And hence not competitive!


## Cloud to the Rescue

What do you mean by _Cloud_ though?


## 5 Essential Cloud Characteristics

- On-demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured service

Note:
from NIST http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf


## 3 Cloud Service Delivery Methods

- Software as a Service _SaaS_: Consume cloud applications.
- Platform as a Service _PaaS_: Leverage the cloud for your own applications.
- Infrastructure as a Service _IaaS_: Be a cloud

Note:
- SaaS is not enough, you dont control the application
- IaaS is to bare bones, but potentially necesary to run your own cloud
- PaasS .. great but you want to be your own PaaS to avoid dependence on PaaS provider


## Deployment Methods

- Public cloud: available to anyone
- Private cloud: only available to you
- Mixed

Note:
- only mixed is truly competitive and possible on a global scale


## Cloud Provider

Either commercial company

- Amazon
- Microsoft
- Google
- Rackspace
- Others

Or your own provider using

- OpenStack


## Which to choose?

- Each cloud introduces lock-in specific API and tools
- No cloud is available globally
- Different advantages over time and location
- Varying stability and up-time

Hence, choose none = all of them.

Note: 
- using multiple clouds is necessary but expensive
- use cloud agnostic tools to reduce cost


## OneOps

Abstracts your application from a specific cloud:

OneOps is the ultimate PaaS!

Design your application once and run and manage in any cloud.

# Introducing OneOps

> Cloud Application Lifecycle Management Tool and your own PaaS


## Scope

With OneOps, your design becomes much more than a simple template. It's a continually maintained dataset where the notion of change is always recognized. In fact, OneOps was created from the ground up to manage the issues that arise with continuous change. In addition, OneOps automatically scales and repairs your application, to ensure high availability and optimal utilization of your cloud infrastructure.

Test application details from Murali
 
 Modify the platform variables to specify which artifact to deploy. This example uses the hello-servlet example app. Make sure that the values assigned to these variables do not contain spaces, as this can cause the Tomcat startup script to fail during deployment.
Click on your assembly (be sure you have selected the "design" phase in the top menu). Click on the 'variables' section (below the breadcrumb trail)
Click on 'appVersion'. Edit the variable, change the value to 1.0-SNAPSHOT.
Click on 'artifactId'. Edit the variable, change the value to hello-servlet.
Click on 'groupId'. Edit the variable, change the value to com.walmart.platform.examples.
Click on 'repositoryURL'. Edit the variable, change the value to http://repo.wal-mart.com.
Save your changes and commit them to your design.
it's actually already there as part of this example
